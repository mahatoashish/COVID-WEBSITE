<p>The Fiddle Pass is an incredible hike in Jasper National Park, Canada. It can be done as an in and out hike from Miette Hot Springs, or as a one way starting in Whitehorse Provincial Park near Cadomin, Alberta. When we did the hike during the first weekend of September, we started in Cadomin and hiked to Miette; spending 2 nights along our approximately 50km trek.</p>

 

<p> We began at the trailhead in Whitehorse Provincial Park, and hiked about 13km during the first day to arrive at Whitehorse Falls. This added some extra distance to our trip, but it was well worth it as the campsite next to the waterfall was fantastic. However, we did have to hike about 400m through a creek to get to the campsite, and the mountain water was very cold on a day that was only about 4°C. This hike has multiple creek and river crossings, so bringing proper footwear and being prepared for this is essential.</p>

<p>Our second day, turned out to be much longer than anticipated as it was about 8km longer than we expected based on the park maps. We ended up hiking nearly 24km this day, and it was a long one. However, we did have some amazing views (including the Fiddle Pass) and river crossings.</p>
